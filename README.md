# 24 points solver

## Recently my friend has often turned to me for help solving classical 24-points game problems, which inspired me to develop a 24-points solver here to help everyone who's ever struggled to figure out if there's really a solution for the tricky numbers they get.

## Usage:

### 1. if you haven't got uv, run: 
``` bash
pip install uv 
```
### 2. run:
``` bash
uv sync
```
### 3. run and follow the instructions
``` bash
uv run main.py
```

## Enjoy this tool! This project is open for everyone so feel free to improve it.
