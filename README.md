# 24 points solver

## Recently my friend often turns to me for solving classical 24 points game solutions, and hence I'm inspired to develop a 24 points solver here to help all those guys who are suffering wondering if there really are solutions for the tricky numbers they get.

## Usage:

### 1. if you haven't got uv, run: 
``` bash
pip install uv 
```
### 2. run:
``` bash
uv sync
```
### 3. run and follow the instructions
``` bash
uv run main.py
```

## Enjoy this tool! This project is open for everyone so feel free to improve it.
